This document is meant to explain the tax calculator app that I have created using Android studio:

As per instructions provided I have also designed and developed three screens,

Screen 1: Splash screen: The first screen when you run the application. It contains Student name and Student Id and Image view 

Screen 2: DataEntry screen: This screen lets user enter data. Data includes SIN number, Name, Income Amount, RRSP Amount, BirthDate and other such details

Screen 3: Display Screen: The last and final screen, once the data is entered in the second screen. This screen will display all the data after tax calculation as per the amount and details entered by the customer.
